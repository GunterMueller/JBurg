ExpressionEvaluator tests interoperability of ANTLR3 and JBurg.

The ANTLR grammar is Ter's expression evaluator sample; see 
http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Expression+evaluator

The BURG compiles code for a MIPS-like target.

System requirements:

ANTLR 3.0.1 or later
JBurg 0.9.8 or later

Build targets:

ant help -- displays options.
ant parser -- builds the ANTLR3 based lexer and parser.
ant BURG -- builds the JBurg based code emitter
ant compilejava -- compiles the generated Java files.
ant build -- executes all build steps.
