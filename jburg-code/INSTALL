To install and build JBurg:

1.  Copy lib/jburg.jar to lib/jburg-known-good.jar
2.  Install the following external tools:

ANT - Build file utility.
   http://jakarta.apache.org/ant
   
ANTLR - Grammar generating tool.
	Used by JBurg to generate its grammar,
    and by the StringTemplate-based code emitter.
	http://www.antlr.org
   
g++ - GNU C++ compiler
    Used by the JBurg self-test tasks to validate C++ code generation.

3.  ant cleanBuildAndTest will build a clean jburg.jar and run its first level acceptance test.
